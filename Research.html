                <h2>Getting back to basics, an oldie but goodie</h2>
                <h5>May 22, 2020 | Eric Choy</h5>
                <p>As we fast forward 10 years later in seeing this arcane Bitcoin thing unfold into this burgeoning industry 
                    spanning myriad facets of our society, and for those that are currently celebrating by eating an all 
                    time favorite but basic of foods, pizza, it’s righteously fitting to look over the basics of Bitcoin’s 
                    bedrock: our private and public keys. It’s very easy to disregard what started it all, but from time to 
                    time it’s not a bad idea to circle back on the fundamentals of Bitcoin. The Bitcoin White Paper is even 
                    listed as a must read article in Messari’s Crypto Thesis 2020 with Selkis even galvanizing us to “show 
                    some respect, dammit!”.</p>

                <p>Although there are a lot of use cases for smart contract protocols, there are 3 in particular that 
                    I think Neo will most likely, not dominate, but have a higher chance of exploiting and gaining 
                    market share from others. This leads us into performing a Sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation, or 
                    break-up analysis, a method of valuation of a multi-divisional conglomerate in a hypothetical 
                    scenario of determining what divisions would be worth if the conglomerate is broken up and spun off.</p>

                <h5>January 25, 2020 | Eric Choy</h5>
                <p>There’s an idiom in Chinese that goes “开源节流“ (kai-yuan-jie-liu), which in its figurative meaning 
                    means to increase income and reduce expenditures. Its literal meaning means to open a water source and 
                    reduce outflow. And as I walk along the riverside towards a mining farm located deep in a Sichuan 
                    village, some 3 and more hours outside of Chengdu, I can almost mentally tie this idiom into the 
                    booming mining industry that has spawned up in China the past decade.</p>

                <p>The Melon Protocol positions itself to be the frontier to Asset Management 3.0, in the same manner of the 
                    Web3 movement, one could say. But to take a step back what was Asset Management 1.0 and Asset 
                    Management 2.0? If you look through Melon’s online media outlets, you will come across these two 
                    terminologies every so often without a clear-cut definition to them, but if we had to delineate between 
                    the two...</p>

                <h5>November 29, 2019 | Eric Choy and Max Hinchman</h5>
                <p>So what is Decentraland? Decentraland is a decentralized 3D virtual reality world that is built on the 
                    Ethereum blockchain. What is unique is that the entire game is created by the users themselves. 
                    Decentraland itself is just a platform. The users then create their own content. Players can buy a 
                    plot of land using the MANA coin and then create almost whatever they want. So think of The Sims 
                    meets Minecraft….with blockchain. In the game itself, players can explore all different areas, which 
                    are divided into districts. For example, players can enter areas that have a casino, a carnival, or 
                    a market.</p>

                <p>In November of 2018 Sia closed their $3.25 million series a round of funding led by Bain Capital 
                    Ventures. So what is it about Sia and decentralized data storage that made it attractive enough 
                    for one of the biggest names in venture capital to write a generous check? By now we are all 
                    aware that the current internet business model has its share of issues. The biggest issue arguably 
                    is that the data on the internet really isn’t secure. The best analogy that I have heard describing 
                    the current situation is that essentially all of our data is kept inside of a house that doesn’t 
                    have any locks. The house keeps us dry and warm, but anyone could walk in and take everything 
                    (or rearrange all of the furniture).</p>

                <p>The Ravencoin protocol has presented itself as a very unique blockchain project. No ICO. No premine. 
                    No negative publicity. All decentralization. And in it for the long game. Ravencoin’s potential 
                    is almost certainly reliant on the tokenization trend that we are seeing being played out in 
                    almost every aspect of crypto. Irrespective of how it’s own native token price unfolds, or more 
                    so to what direction Bitcoin goes towards, the Ravencoin protocol is a project that genuinely 
                    sets out to provide value to the crypto world.</p>
