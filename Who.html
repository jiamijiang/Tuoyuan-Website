                        large AUMs. Finance has been the majority of his background and has given him the repertoire 
                        of skills to understand businesses, economics, and new emerging asset classes such as crypto. 
                        And within crypto is the ability to explore further down the rabbit hole of blockchain, 
                        elliptic curves, and the fast-paced landscape of crypto exchanges.</p>
