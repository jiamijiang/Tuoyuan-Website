            <p>Tuoyuan, or properly pronounced as Tuǒyuán, stems from the Chinese translation of elliptic, 
                which is 椭圆. An underrecognized fundamental property of bitcoin and the host of other 
                cryptocurrencies is the mathematical study of elliptic curve cryptography.</p>

            <h4>thesis</h4>
            <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that has no one controller. There is no central 
                bank or central entity that controls the supply of it. It is completely free from the control 
                of any one person. And it uses a database called blockchain to store and verify all transactions 
                in a secure and transparent manner. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The beautiful thing about bitcoin is that I can send you a transaction, from anywhere in the 
                world in a matter of seconds, without anyone stopping me from doing that. And that transaction 
                will be recorded on the blockchain forever. And nobody can ever alter or delete that transaction. 
                Because blockchain’s decentralized nature instills trust. And it is decentralized because the 
                network is shared amongst thousands of computers that are running the Bitcoin program. Most of 
                these people that are running the Bitcoin program are what they call bitcoin miners. They are 
                the ones creating and securing the blockchain through a consensus mechanism known as Proof of Work. 
                This is done through mining machines that are calculating complex mathematical algorithms all 
                day but this is another topic that can be discussed another day. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>But the greatest thing that the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, invented is the decentralized 
                mechanism for emergent consensus.</strong> Emergent, because consensus is not achieved explicitly — there 
                is no election or fixed moment when consensus occurs. Instead, consensus is an emergent artifact 
                of the asynchronous interaction of thousands of independent nodes, all following simple rules. All 
                the properties of bitcoin, including currency, transactions, payments, and the security model that 
                does not depend on central authority or trust, derive from this invention.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a lot of hype that Bitcoin has received and there is a lot of doubters that don’t believe 
                in Bitcoin. Many might think the people who believe in Bitcoin are crazy. How can Bitcoin take 
                over our central banks and become a daily payment currency? But one could also say that, our 
                monetary system is not permanent. It hasn’t been around forever. It changes every couple of 
                centuries. Before the US dollar, which is not backed by anything but belief, used to be backed by 
                gold. Before that gold was used once used as a form of payment. Paper fiat currency wasn’t always 
                around and there was a point when people used cowrie shells as a form of payment. The trends always 
                change because there is always a more better, efficient, faster, and fairer way of doing something.
            </p> 
            <p>   
                If you look at what is going on the past decades of constant money printing and rising debts by our 
                central banks, one could ask the question of: is this sustainable? Many developing countries are already 
                suffering from hyperinflation and a lost of faith in their currency such as Lebanon and Venezuela. 
                The three main functions of a currency are as a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value. 
                Bitcoin has all three of these characteristics. Yes I agree that Bitcoin will probably never become a global 
                daily currency but there are other alternative cryptocurrencies that improve upon Bitcoin’s weaknesses. Will 
                these become the next global currency? Who knows… But at least it gives us an option. Just in the same manner 
                that smartphones and newspapers still coexists.
